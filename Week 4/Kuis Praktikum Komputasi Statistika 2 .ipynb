    "In statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Spearman's ρ, <br/>\n",
    "named after Charles Spearman and often denoted by the Greek letter $\\rho$ (rho) or as $r_s$ is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). <br/>\n",
    "It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values of those two variables; <br/>\n",
    "while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, <br/>\n",
    "Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). <br/>\n",
    "If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition and calculation\n",
    "The Spearman correlation coefficient is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the rank variables For a sample of size n, <br/>\n",
    "the n raw scores $X_i, Y_i$ are converted to ranks $R(X_i), R(Y_i)$ and and $r_s$ is computed as :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_s = \\rho_{R(X),R(Y)} = \\frac{cov(R(X),R(Y))}{\\sigma_{R(X)}\\sigma_{R(Y)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Only if all n ranks are distinct integers, this test can be used to determine whether the population variable is one <br/>\n",
    "with the two independent variable populations or not. The formula for calculating value <br/>\n",
    "Spearman's correlation coefficient is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6\\sum{d^2_{i}}}{n(n^2-1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $\\rho$ : is the value of the Spearman correlation coefficient\n",
    "* $cov(R(X),R(Y))$ : is the covariance of the rank variables,\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{R(X)}$ and $\\sigma_{R(Y)}$ : are the standard deviations of the rank variables.\n",
    "* $d^2_{i}$ : is the difference between each rank pair\n",
    "* $n$ : is the number of rank pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we calculate $Z_{hit}$ using formulas $Z_{hit} = \\rho\\sqrt{n-1}$ where value of $Z_{hit}$ will compared with $Z_{tab}$. <br/> The hypothesis test for this test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0$ : X and Y are independent <br/>\n",
    "$H_1$ : X and Y are dependent <br/>\n",
